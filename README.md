# MUlti-Person Pose Estimation
Multi-person pose estimation is a critical problem in sports analysis that involves tracking the movements of multiple players simultaneously. Accurately detecting and tracking the body poses of players can provide valuable insights into their performance and help coaches and analysts make informed decisions. However, existing pose estimation techniques often struggle to handle the complex and fast-moving scenarios that are common in sports, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete pose estimates. Therefore, there is a need for a robust and real-time multi-person pose estimation system tailored specifically for sports analysis that can handle fast movements and occlusions while maintaining high accuracy.
